# idgen short ID generator

## About

idgen is a tool for formatting GUIDs as base62 strings. GUIDs are nice as identifiers but there are 
plenty of cases where their format is unwieldy. Base62 uses the full alphabet and both letter cases
to represent the same ID in a more compact form.

Also included is incgen, which is intended to format numeric integral (usually monotonically increasing) IDs in the same manner.

## Usage

```
$ idgen


```
